# If_Two_Strings_Are_Equal
--C Language-- : after I split an input string into two strings and tried to check if they are the inverse of each other

My code was writen in c language.
------------------------------------------------------C language------------------------------------------------------
The task is to take a string input from the user example: ABA*ABA

using this i will split it into two strings: string1 and string2, before the '*' is the first string and after it the second string

then i wrote a function called isReverse of type int to return 1 if the the strings1,2 are identical
however I am facing a problem in the this function

I have tested the program and located that the problem lies in isReverse function

Can you please tell me what's wrong with this code?
